                    <p>Hi, my name is Morest Burawa and I am a passionate Software Engineering student at ALX Africa. My journey in data and technology began with a strong curiosity for how information can drive impactful decisions. Before joining ALX, I gained valuable experience as a data entry clerk intern, where I collaborated with multiple teams to capture and clean data for major investment projects. One of my proudest achievements was working with Nzalo Carers, where I partnered with a team of six to successfully capture and register data for over 5,000 students from various schools and provinces for a national competition.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed strong skills in teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving. I am committed to continuous learning and adaptability, always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. My goal is to empower businesses and organizations with data-driven insights that spark innovation and growth.

In addition to my collaborative projects, I have built my own professional portfolio to showcase my skills and achievements. I am driven by a belief that beyond data lies the vision to spark decisions and ignite growth. I look forward to completing my studies at ALX, further developing my expertise, and ultimately building a business of my own. I am proud to have received three consecutive leadership certificates and to have completed my matric successfully.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am excited to connect, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful projects in the world of data science!
